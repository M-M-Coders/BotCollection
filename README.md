# Instructions
For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of available bots, among other features. Try your best to find the right
places to insert code into the established code base.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given
instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in
how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for
setting up the application.

# Project Guidelines
Your project should conform to the following set of guidelines:

# Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
